//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
--> BFS
Andrei-> BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
--> BFS
Andrei-> BFS (DFS will take long time), but may have memory concern

//If the tree is very wide:
--> BFS(?)
Andrei-> DFS (BFS will need to much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
--> DFS
Andrei-> DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
--> DFS
Andrei-> DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
--> BFS(?)
Andrei-> BFS
